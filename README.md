# TenPinBowling
This app is created in React Js using React components.  This app is the primary approach to writing a program for a scoring a game of Ten Pin Bowling. This app is event based and interacts with the Player

Curretly it supports one player and scores based on the pins hit in the allocated chances.

_**How it works:**_
1. A frame consists of 2 chances
1. The numbers in Green Circles that appear on the UI is assumed to be the number of pins knocked down by a single roll. For instance, if you think on chance 1, the player knocks down 5 pins, you must click number 5 green circle to denote the roll. If it is a strike, number 10 must be clicked. if it is a gutter then 0 and so on.
1. when On a frame, if a player hits less than 10, then the next chance will have the numbers that can add up to 10. For instance, when a player hits 5 in the first chance of a frame, then for the next chance, the options presented will be 0,1,2,3,4,5 which means he needs to hit only 5 balls max to get a spare. if the player hits a 0, then the score for that frame is 5.
1. The UI is basic uses bootstraps classes since the focus is purely on react js and unit tests.

_**This app properly :**_

* awards the player with 2 Bonus chances in the last frame if it is a strike
* awards the player with One Bonus chance in the last frame if it is a spare.
* Calculates score after each frame's chances are over 
* Updates total score after each and every chance.

## Project Overview

* This app is built using React js as the front end js framework.
* Babel is used for transpilation of ES6 and jsx into plain javascript for all browsers
* Webpack is used for bundling, module handling and loaders for various things like css, assets, plugins, js file serving and so on

## Unit testing (TDD)

The unit testing is done using Jest and Enzyme. All the node modules necessary for this testing framework have been included in the package.json
both shallow and mount features of enzyme are used to unit test the code

To make the app run on your local, simply clone it on to your mac and
* open a terminal and navigate to the app's physical directory
* type npm install - this will pull down all the packages mentioned in the package.json required for this app from npm gallery
* type npm run build - this is webpack's build shortcut. It will compile the app successfully, if there are any errors, it will be listed on the terminal
* type npm run start. 
* this will initiate a port 8080 and the app will listen on this port. The app can be accesed on a browser by navigating to http://localhost:8080
